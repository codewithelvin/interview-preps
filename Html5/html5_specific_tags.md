### HTML 5 specific tags

HTML5 introduced several new semantic tags that are specific to structuring web content. These tags are designed to improve code **readability**, **accessibility**, and **SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** while providing more context to web documents.

Here are some HTML5 specific tags and their purposes:

1. `<header>`: Represents introductory content at the beginning of a section or page. Typically contains headings, logos, navigation menus, etc. Helps to identify the header of a document or section.

2. `<footer>`: Represents a footer for its nearest section or the whole document. Often contains metadata, copyright information, links to related documents, etc.

3. `<nav>`: Defines a navigation menu, typically containing links to other pages or sections within the website. Helps to identify navigational elements.

4. `<article>`: Represents a self-contained piece of content that can be independently distributed or reused. Commonly used for blog posts, news articles, comments, etc.

5. `<section>`: Represents a thematic grouping of content, typically with a heading. Used to divide a document into sections for easier organization and styling.

6. `<aside>`: Represents content that is related to the surrounding content but can be considered separate from it. Often used for sidebars, pull quotes, advertisements, etc.

7. `<main>`: Specifies the main content of the document. Helps to identify the primary content area, especially in documents with multiple sections.

8. `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`: Used together to represent content such as images, diagrams, illustrations, etc., along with their captions.

9. `<details>` and `<summary>`: Used together to create interactive disclosure widgets, allowing users to show or hide additional information.

These HTML5 tags provide better semantics, making it easier for developers to understand the structure and purpose of web documents. 

They also improve accessibility by providing more context to assistive technologies like screen readers. Additionally, search engines can better understand the content and hierarchy of the document, potentially improving search engine rankings.
